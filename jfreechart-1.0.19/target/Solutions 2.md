## Generating Javadoc

Generating a Javadoc file for JFreechart was significantly easier because the Netbeans IDE
includes the ability to generate Javadoc files as part of its functionality. All I had to 
do was add JFreechart to the list of projects tracked by Netbeans. I then right-clicked on the 
project and selected *Generate Javadoc*. The documentation was automatically saved into
the JFreechart project folder, so I simply copied the HTML into the *javadoc* folder.
